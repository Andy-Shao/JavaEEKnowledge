ant -Dwar.name=rand deploy

curl http://localhost:8080/rs?wsdl

The clients in the random subdirectory can be modified to go against the Tomcat-deployed version by
changing the URLs.

You could use the wsimport command build the client method.
e.g.
wsimport -p client -keep http://localhost:8080/rs?wsdl
-p - package name
-keep - keep the codes
